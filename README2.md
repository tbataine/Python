# Control Structures, Functions, and Modules in Python.


Control Structures
Control structures in Python are constructs that control the flow of execution of the program. They include conditional statements, loops, and other control flow mechanisms.
Conditional Statements
if, elif, and else
Conditional statements allow the execution of different code blocks based on certain conditions.

Loops
for Loop
The for loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).

while Loop
The while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.

break and continue
break terminates the loop.
continue skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration.

Functions
Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword. They allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks.
Defining Functions

Modules
Modules in Python are files containing Python code. They can define functions, classes, and variables, and can also include runnable code. Modules help in organizing and reusing code.
Creating a Module
To create a module, save the code in a file with a .py extension.

Importing a Module
Use the import statement to use functions and variables from a module.
import mymodule

From ... Import
You can also import specific functions or variables from a module.
from mymodule import add, subtract


Standard Library Modules
Python comes with a standard library of modules, such as math, datetime, os, and many more.
import math



### Conclusion

Understanding control structures, functions, and modules is crucial for writing efficient and organized Python code. Control structures manage the flow of your program, functions encapsulate reusable code, and modules organize and share your code across different parts of your application. With these basics, you can build more complex and robust Python applications.
